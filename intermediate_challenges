1. You are working on a data analysis project at Deloitte where you need to analyze a dataset containing information about various cities. 
   Your task is to calculate the population density of these cities, rounded to the nearest integer, and identify the cities with the minimum and 
   maximum densities. The population density should be calculated as (Population / Area).
   The output should contain 'city', 'country', 'density'.

   SOLUTION
   WITH pop_density_cal AS (
       SELECT 
           city, 
           country, 
           ROUND((population/NULLIF(area, 0))) AS density --- NULLIF is used to avoid zero divisor errors
       FROM cities_population),
       
       max_min_density AS(
       SELECT city, country, density,
       RANK() OVER(ORDER BY density DESC) as max_density,
       RANK() OVER(ORDER by density ASC) AS min_density
       FROM pop_density_cal)
       
   SELECT city, country, density
   FROM max_min_density
   WHERE max_density = 1 or min_density = 1; --- filtering by the city with the highest and lowest rank
   

 
2. You're tasked with analyzing a Spotify-like dataset that captures user listening habits.
   For each user, calculate the total listening time and the count of unique songs they've listened to. In the database duration values are displayed in seconds. 
   Round the total listening duration to the nearest whole minute. 

   Question link - https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10367-aggregate-listening-data?code_type=1


   The output should contain three columns: 'user_id', 'total_listen_duration', and 'unique_song_count'.   SOLUTION 

   WITH user_listen AS (
    SELECT user_id, 
    COUNT(DISTINCT song_id) AS unique_song_count,
    SUM(listen_duration) AS total_duration_secs
    from listening_habits
    GROUP BY user_id
    )
    
   SELECT 
       user_id,
       unique_song_count,
       ROUND(total_duration_secs / 60.0)) AS total_listen_duration  -- Sum durations and convert to minutes, then round
   FROM user_listen;

   ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION 

   SELECT 
       user_id,
       ROUND(SUM(listen_duration) / 60.0) AS total_listen_duration, -- Sum durations and convert to minutes, then round
       COUNT(DISTINCT song_id) AS unique_song_count -- Count distinct songs
   FROM 
       listening_habits
   GROUP BY 
       user_id;



3. Calculate each user's average session time. A session is defined as the time difference between a page_load and page_exit. 
   For simplicity, assume a user has only 1 session per day and if there are multiple of the same events on that day, consider 
   only the latest page_load and earliest page_exit, with an obvious restriction that the load time event should happen before exit
   time event. Output the user_id and their average session time.

   SOLUTION 1 - USING CTES AND INNER JOIN
   
      WITH PL_tbl AS 
              (
                  SELECT user_id, timestamp::DATE AS date, 
                  MAX(timestamp::time) AS time, action
                  FROM facebook_web_log
                  WHERE action='page_load'
                  GROUP BY user_id, timestamp::DATE, action
              ),
            PE_tbl AS (
                  SELECT user_id, timestamp::DATE AS date, 
                  MIN(timestamp::time) AS time, action
                  FROM facebook_web_log
                  WHERE action='page_exit'
                  GROUP BY user_id, timestamp::DATE, action
            )  
      
      SELECT e.user_id, AVG(e.time - l.time) 
      FROM PL_tbl l
      JOIN PE_tbl e
      ON l.user_id = e.user_id AND l.date = e.date AND e.time > l.time
      GROUP BY e.user_id;

      SOLUTION 2 - USING SELF JOIN 



4. Find contract starting dates of the top 5 most paid Lyft drivers. Consider only drivers who are still 
   working with Lyft.

   QUESTION LINK: https://platform.stratascratch.com/coding/10083-start-dates-of-top-drivers?code_type=1

5. Capital One's marketing team is working on a project to analyze customer feedback from their feedback surveys.


   The team sorted the words from the feedback into three different categories;
   •	short_comments
   •	mid_length_comments
   •	long_comments


   The team wants to find comments that are not short and that come from social media. The output should include 
   'feedback_id,' 'feedback_text,' 'source_channel,' and a calculated category.

   QUESTION LINK: 

   SOLUTION 
   select 
    feedback_id,
    feedback_text,
    source_channel
    from customer_feedback
    where 
        comment_category <> 'short_comments' AND source_channel = 'social_media';



6. You are provided with a transactional dataset from Amazon that contains detailed information about sales across different products and marketplaces. Your task is to list the top 3 sellers in each product category for January.
